# Clinic Management System

The **Clinic Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline operations in a clinic. It facilitates seamless interaction between receptionists and doctors while managing patient records, prescriptions and billing. The system is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and leverages **Firebase** for backend services.

---

## Architecture

### 1. Frontend (Client-Side Application)
The client-side application is responsible for user interaction and comprises the following modules:
- **Receptionist Module:**
  - Register patients with personal details.
  - System assigns sequential token numbers to the patients.
  - Generate bills.
  - View patient records.
- **Doctor Module:**
  - Access patient details using token numbers.
  - Add prescriptions and symptoms for patients.
  - View patient medical history for informed decision-making.
- **Shared Features:**
  - Both receptionist and doctor can view patient history.

### 2. Backend (Firebase Services)
The system uses Firebase for backend services:
- **Firebase Authentication:**
  - Manages user roles (Receptionist, Doctor).
  - Secures data access and ensures role-based permissions.
- **Firebase Firestore (Database):**
  - Stores:
    - Patient information (name, age, address, contact details and token numbers).
    - Prescriptions (symptoms and medicines added by doctors).
    - Billing information.
  - Provides real-time updates for seamless interaction between the receptionist and doctor.
- **Firebase Hosting:**
  - Hosts the web application, ensuring global availability and fast response times.

### 1. Patient Registration (Receptionist)
- Receptionist enters patient details into the system.
- A sequential token number is assigned to the patient by the system.
- The patient record is stored in Firestore.

### 2. Prescription Entry (Doctor)
- Doctor accesses patient records by token number.
- Adds symptoms and prescriptions to the patientâ€™s history.
- Updates are saved in Firestore and synchronized in real-time.

### 3. Bill Creation (Receptionist)
- Receptionist generates a bill.
- Amount is recorded and the bill is stored in Firestore.

### 4. View Patient History
- Both the receptionist and doctor can view patient history.
- History is fetched from Firestore for easy tracking of past visits.

## Security and Access Control
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Receptionist: Register patients, view patient records and generate bills.
  - Doctor: Add prescriptions and view patient records.
- **Firestore Security Rules:**
  - Restrict read and write access based on the userâ€™s role and authentication status.

---

## Key Advantages
1. **Scalability:**
   - Firebaseâ€™s serverless architecture automatically scales with the clinicâ€™s needs.
2. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Firestore ensures updated records are visible instantly.
3. **Modularity:**
   - Clear separation of responsibilities between receptionist and doctor.
4. **Ease of Deployment:**
   - Firebase Hosting makes the application globally accessible with minimal effort.
5. **Data Consistency:**
   - Using `serverTimestamp` ensures reliable and consistent timestamps.

---

## Future Enhancements
This architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for potential future features such as:
- Appointment scheduling.
- Notifications for patients and staff.
- Advanced analytics for patient and clinic performance insights.
